<h2>Flashlight</h2>
<ul>

<li><strong>High Concept:</strong>
Find the MacGuffin whilst being pursued by a spoopy ghost, with a really short-lasting battery.</li>

<li><strong>Player Experience Goals:</strong>
They're supposed to be spooked, with a sense of impending doom.
</li>

<li><strong>Genre:</strong>
Survival Horror
</li>

<li><strong>Game play:</strong>
The player may move left, right, up, or down in a manner similar to other top-down games using the arrow keys.

The spacebar activates/deactivates the flashlight. Ostensibly, the flashlight would be able to banish evil spirits, but I didn't get to that feature. Oh well.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype goal:</strong>
A flashlight with battery life, along with a pursuing enemy and proximity-based sound effects.
</li>

<li><strong>Features:</strong>
Experience true fear as a 81x81 ghost descends upon you!
Realistic non-functioning flashlight!
</li>

<li><strong>Setting/Premise:</strong>
It's supposed to be a normal, modern setting with some deep, dark things hiding in the shadows. Ghosts 
are real, and they are wrathful, murderous, and full of suffering. It is well that a ghost is a rare thing to come across, because God help you if you stumble upon one. 
</li>

<li><strong>Story:</strong>
A man finds his brother's journal one cold spring night; it speaks of his brother's house and the horrors he found within. The man decides to investigate
</li>

<li><strong>Target Audience:</strong>
The type of guy who plays Amnesia:Dark Descent and other spooky games. Horror fans, basically. </li>

<li><strong>Play time:</strong>
Around 30 seconds, depending on how conservative you are with battery life.
</li>

<li><strong>Strategies:</strong>
I'll be the first to admit that this isn't the most complete game around, so strategy isn't really a factor, here. Most of my time was spent implementing the flashlight business and getting the assets setup.
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Assets:</strong>
All sprites came from spriters-resource.com.
Breathing sound effect from soundbible.com
'Aftermath' by Kevin MacLeod, incompetech.com
</li>

<li><strong>Prototype Closest Other Game:</strong>
I borrowed some movement code from the StarStruck example, and took inspiration from the audio, timer, and masking examples. 

This would be most similar to a little known game called Ao Oni, (JAP: "Blue Demon"). Like that game, I'm going for a top-down horror sort of game.
